There is nothing here but some words.(kind of useless?)
We will go to school in two weeks,and it`s also a time to look at the 'new' world.Ohhhh,we will have toooooo much homework!...
I think staying at home is comfortable and safe.
I`m afraid that I`ll be unable to travel around the country.

20200429 So what can I say?Bad ,too bad...It is like a battle that never end?Or something that I can't imagine such as a terrible dream..?
20200429 You should face it because you are no longer a child(What do I mean?I will never know)
20200429 Is someone bored enough to see the boring words to guess what does the author mean???Maybe nobody,including my friends...

 20200507 Eight days!! I went to a certain place and lost myself..It's my world!
 20020507 Will somebody see it?  Especially my best friends!!They won't know what I've done so they'll never find these useless words..
 20200507 I have a question:When will the baaaaaaad dream end?Oh,the confirmed number is about 3,600,000??It was very small in March,but now...nine times??!!

20200704 The Final Exam for senior high school students is on July 7!!And ours is only ten days after that..OH!
20200704 The number of confirmed people is above 10,000,000.Only half a year. TOO FAST TO BELIEVE.(Is the sentence correct?)
20200704 It becomes very serious and all of us must face it for it may..cause...someting bad...

20200919 I haven't updated it for nearly three months!I can only say:"How time fliesÔºÅ"
20200919 ok I'm now in a new school to start my senior high school. I did badly in the senior High school entrance examination unfortunately...... 
20200919 Just keep walking and ignore others' words.It's a new start,isn't it?? 
20200919... the number of confirmed people is over 30,000,000 ,ten times more than'20200507'.......So we should do something to make the number lower.
