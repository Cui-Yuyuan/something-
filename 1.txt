There is nothing here but some words.(kind of useless?)
We will go to school in two weeks,and it`s also a time to look at the 'new' world.Ohhhh,we will have toooooo much homework!...
I think staying at home is comfortable and safe.
I`m afraid that I`ll be unable to travel around the country.

20200410 Are you guy sure???? Nobody can predict the future!
20200410 Time runs quickly!!!!!!(20210530It is true.I agree with you.Remember the days that you had and enjoy them for you will find something that will shock you!Never be regretful for anything right you did.)
20200411 Oh I only want to speak nothing..(20200704 Good.The same as 'me'.)
20200422 Eleven days past...Oh yes,we'll have the final exam on July 17th~19th!
20200422 We've returned school for two weeks!!The words that I said on my birthday is true...Time runs REAAAAALLY fast!!(20210530 Ha naive..)
20200422 Will I go somewhere mysterious during the shortest summer vacation?But I'm looking forward to it!
20200429 Too terrible!The number is about 2,990,000!!0.5million!! 
20200429 So what can I say?Bad ,too bad...It is like a battle that never end?Or something that I can't imagine such as a terrible dream..?(20200919 Maybe life is like a dream??)
20200429 You should face it because you are no longer a child(What do I mean?I will never know)
20200429 Is someone bored enough to see the boring words to guess what does the author mean???Maybe nobody,including my friends...
20200429 Ha!I've spent nearly a month to write the words but get nothing from them..MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE A GOOD REST FROM NOW ON!!!

 20200507 Eight days!! I went to a 'certain' place and lost myself..It's my world!
 20020507 Will somebody see it?  Especially my best friends!!They won't know what I've done so they'll never find these useless words..
 20200507 I have a question:When will the baaaaaaad dream end?Oh,the confirmed number is about 3,600,000??It was very small in March,but now...nine times??!!
 20200507 I find that I will have a final examination to examine my junior high school life.It is the hardest exam??I don't think so.COME ON,YOU WILL BE THE WINNER AND FIND SOMETHING BETTER!!
 20200507 GO FOR IT.(20200704 NEVER GIVE UP.The victory will belong to you!!(20201203 Finally,I BECOME a loser..))

20200704 It has been two months..I can say nothing to express myself...The FINAL EXAMINATION is on July 17.I've no time to prepare for it.But I will try my best to do it!
20200704 The Final Exam for senior high school students is on July 7!!And ours is only ten days after that..OH!
20200704 The number of confirmed people is above 10,000,000.Only half a year. TOO FAST TO BELIEVE.(Is the sentence correct?)
20200704 It becomes very serious and all of us must face it for it may..cause...someting bad...
20200704 Will I be able to remember everything I did?I'm afraid not.
20200704 Value it!(20200919 Just do what you can.)

20200919 I haven't updated it for nearly three months!I can only say:"How time fliesÔºÅ"
20200919 ok I'm now in a new school to start my senior high school. I did badly in the senior High school entrance examination unfortunately...... 
20200919 Just keep walking and ignore others' words.It's a new start,isn't it?? 
20200919 ... the number of confirmed people is over 30,000,000 ,ten times more than'20200507'.......So we should do something to make the number lower. 
20200919 I admit that I am so stressful now because of the damn gaokao. The only thing I can do is to fight on like three months ago in the following three years to enter a good university. JUST DOOOOOOOO IT!!!
20200919 A new term means a new start. 
20200919 I'll be stronger after the three years and finally gain a fantastic...gift(?).
20200919 The words above are like blogs? 

20201202 omg!!every things disappeared!!!oh no!
20201202 (crying)I'm so sad:-( :=========(
20201202 i just want to say,twice than before. you know?
20201203 When the horrible dream can be ended?
20201203 ah...I don't want to say it out,but I have to do so. The sentence is "One year,two worlds"... Just ONE year,over 1M people died... "It's a sad story",you know... 
20201203 I'll never regret although I chose the way to go,to think,to live,to do anything I can... So here is a sentence:JUST DO IT!
20201203 I just want to calm myself down.the hard time will reshape my personality,and widen my horizon,and change my opinion to the world... 
20201203 i was naive,right?but I Will be changed forever!

 20210130 Ahh two months has passed...The pandemic becomes more and more serious than ever.. Look at the data two minutes ago.. I can regard it as a peaceful period of time. (You know what I mean?)
 20210130 The name is over 100,000,000,(WARNING) times more. 
 20210130 And even DONALD TRUMP change to JOE BIDEN! (2021013 CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!)
 20210130 We can say the world has been changed for ever for the things happening these days. 
 20210130 Now I'm worried about what will happen in the future. It is unpredictable and mysterious. It is full of unknown things. 
 20210130 Just remember what had happened in the past 31536000 seconds(one year). You'll find something interesting or...(no word to describe)
 20210130 This year,we still have much to do. 
 20210131 The month just left a few hours.In a word,THIS JANUARY is interesting. But now I just want to say... E or w,h is b.(you know?)
 20210131 And to tell the truth,I was afraid of being in a "dark atmosphere",but now I get used to it.. 
 20210131 I'm getting older..BUT nothing serious.. I have much time to do what I want,what I like,what I...Just do it!

20210201 What a nice day!A good start.. 
20210201 I remembered that the activity held by ariss...Nice!So I put the JUNK PICTURES on this website.
20210201 But everything has gone.. 
 
 20210319 Ok one month passed... Toooooooo many things had taken place during these days. 
 20210319 I was moved to another class and try hard to get along with new classmates(little boring?)
 20210319 3.11 was the tenth anniversary of the horrible earthquake which happened in Japan.. Just ten years passed silently. I cannot believe that time goes so fast but I have to accept the truth.
 20210319 Every time,every thing,every person,every place.. 
 20210319 What a sad tale for me.. But no sympathy needed. Thank you man...
 20210321 Just a nice day.. We'll have an essential examination to check our level of knowledge and just..(you know!)
 20210321 Maybe you can not get the meaning what I want to express exactly and directly,but by reading these words.Deep mind cannot be found easily!Just drown yourself into these and you'll getting more than you want.
 20210329 A week later.. I just have learned something from several main social medias that... something bad happened to us.We'd better solve them rapidly for political(?)and..reasons.
 
 20210530 Now this term is going to end in about one month.I gave a presentation in my class and the topic was the Chernobyl Accident.That`s what I want to upload.
 20210530 35 years has passed silently..Just on Apr.26,1986,it broke suddenly.
 20210530 So many things should be done to prevent such a thing from happening..
 20210530 And,we COULDN`T TELL LIES!

20210906 Some useless programmes should be uploaded but I just forgot it.
20210906 The file may be too large so ithe next year I'm goinh to upload another one.
20210906 And then,I guess MinecraftPE 1.19 will be available.More attracting things will be updated?
20210906 It's not a good trend that the number of confirmed people is still rising and the total number is above 200000000!
20210906 Another thing.The collapse of USSR.From December 26th,1991 to September 6th, 2021,almost THIRTY years.Something should be remembered.RIGHT?OURS is the most important!!( :) )

 20211027 It's time to add something into this file.
 20211027 Big changes have taken place during these golden days..But all of them has flown away..
 20211027 I just want to express my real feelings but it seems that some kinds of barrier stops me from doing it...
 20211027 For example,the uncontinuous mind and the uncomplete thoughts.Those are the fatal disadvantages,but they are akso hard to overcome so I have to let them go.You know?
 20211027 Later,I'll be busier and may have no time to edit the paragraphs.
 20211027 Best wishes to all the people who have read the text.Maybe it's the only thing I can say to all of you.
 
 
 20220107 Whoa!It's been three months since the last login!
 20220107 These days,I'm busy dealing something about my study.But during it,a horrible thing happened:today,the total confirmed is over 300,000,000(exactly,over300,300,000).........
 20220107 To tell the truth,I have no time to write more codes for a load of things are waiting me to be dealt..
 20220107 Also,the city I live in is also in a "mess":on account of some people,the virus broke out..
 20220107 In fact,I'll keep on updating this document whenever and wherever I am and whatever happens.
 20220107 KEEP ON FIGHTING!
